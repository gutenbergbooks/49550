<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Richard Edwards</span> (the elder), a Somersetshire man, was born about the
year 1523, and is said to have received his education at Corpus
Christi College, Oxford, whence “in youthful years,” as he himself
narrates, in the “Paradise of Dainty Devices,” but not until after
August 1544, “his young desires pricked him forth to serve in court, a
slender, tall young man.” What his service at court may have been,
does not appear, and he relinquished it for a time in 1547, when he
was nominated a Senior Student of Christ Church, Oxford, then newly
founded by Henry VIII., and created M.A. Here, among other studies, he
applied himself to that of music, under George Etheridge, with a view,
probably, to further service at court. On his return to London, he
entered himself of Lincoln’s Inn, and ultimately was constituted by
Queen Elizabeth a Gentleman
<!--0009.png-->
of the Chapel Royal, and, in 1561, Master
of the Children or singing boys of that establishment. Warton, after
stating that Edwards “united all those arts and accomplishments which
minister to popular pleasantry,” which may be very true, adds what (as
Collier points out) is unquestionably a mistake, that the children of
the chapel were first formed by him into a company of players; for
they had regularly acted plays long before.</p>

<p>In 1566, Edwards attended the Queen in her visit to Oxford, where he
composed a play called “Palamen and Arcite,” which was acted before
Her Majesty in Christ Church Hall.</p>

<p>Stow, in his “Chronicle,” mentions the name of the play, and adds that
“it had such tragical success as was very lamentable; for at that
time, by the fall of a wall and a paire of staires &amp; great prese
(press) of the multitude, three men were slain.” “At night” (Sept. 2<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>),
writes Anthony Wood, “the Queen heard the first part of an English
play, named Palamon &amp; Arcyte, made by M. Richard Edwards, a gentleman
of her Chapel, acted with very great applause, in Christ Church Hall,
at the beginning of which play, there was, by part of the stage which
fell, three persons slain, besides five that were hurt. Afterwards the
actors performed their parts so well, that the Queen laughed heartily
thereat, and gave the author of the play great thanks for his pains”
(quoted by Collier, “Annals of the Stage,”
<!--0010.png-->
<abbr title="one">i.</abbr>, 191). “Her Majesty
also presented eight guineas to one of the young performers who gave
her peculiar satisfaction. It is fair to add, in behalf of good Queen
Bess, that from Peshall’s ‘History of the University,’ it would seem
that the Queen was not present on the occasion of the accident.” He
died on the 31st October in the same year, according to Hawkins; and
in Turbervile’s Poems, printed in 1567, are two elegiac compositions
on his decease, one by Turbervile himself, the other by Thomas Twine,
the translator of Virgil.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“Edwards,” writes Collier,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> “enjoyed a very high reputation as a
dramatic poet, but he seems to have owed much of it to the then
comparative novelty of his undertakings.” Thomas Twine, in an epitaph
upon his death, calls him<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem smaller">
<div class="versei4">        “The flower of our realm</div>
<div class="versei2">And Phœnix of our age,”</div>
</div>

<p>and specifically mentions two of his plays, “Damon and Pythias” and
“Palamon and Arcyte,” adding, however, that he had written more
equally fit for the ears of princes<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem smaller">
<div class="versei2">“Thy tender Tunes and Rimes</div>
<div class="versei3">  Wherein thou woont’st to play,</div>
<div class="versei2">Eche princely Dame of Court and Towne,</div>
<div class="versei3">  Shall beare in minde alway.</div>
<div class="versei2">Thy Damon and his Friend,</div>
<div class="versei3">  Arcyte and Palemon,</div>
<!--0011.png-->
<div class="versei2">With moe full fit for princes’ eares,</div>
<div class="versei3">  Though thou from earth art gone,</div>
<div class="versei2">Shall still remain in fame,” &amp;c.</div>
</div>

<p>He is mentioned in Webbe’s “Discourse of English Poetry,” 1586, and
Puttenham, in his “Art of English Poesie,” 1589, tells us that the
Earl of Oxford (of whose dramatic productions there is no other trace)
and Edwards deserve the highest prize for “comedy and interlude; and
Lord Buckhurst and Master Edward Ferrys [George Ferrers] for tragedy.”
Meres, in his “Palladis Tamia,” 1598, repeats the applause given by
Puttenham, with the omission of the word “interlude,” then out of
fashion, terming Edwards “one of the best for comedy.”</p>

<p>“The earliest notice we have of Edwards as a dramatic poet,” continues
Collier, “occurs in 1564-5, when a tragedy by him, the name of which
is not given, was performed by the children of the chapel, under his
direction, before the Queen at Richmond. This might possibly be his
‘Damon and Pythias,’ termed by Lord Burghley, in the uncertain
phraseology of that time, ‘a tragedy,’ or it might be one of the other
dramatic performances of which, according to Twine, Edwards was the
author. ‘Damon and Pythias,’ however, is the only extant specimen of
his talents in this department of Poetry.” Besides his dramatic
productions, Edwards was the author of several poems in “The Paradyse
of Daynty Devises” (1576), the <em>sundry pithie and learned
inventions</em> of which, indeed, are announced in the title to have
been “devised and written for the most part by
<!--0012.png-->
M. Edwards, sometime
of her Majesties Chapel.” Two of these <em>learned inventions</em> are
given by Ellis, in his “Specimen of Early English Poets,” vol. ii.,
and one of them in especial has aroused the enthusiasm of Mr Haslewood
by the happiness of the illustration, the facility, elegance, and
tenderness of the language, and the exquisite turn of the whole.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span>
“When he was in extremitie of his sickness,” writes Wood, narrating
our author’s death, “he composed a noted poem, called ‘Edwards’ Soul
Knil’ (knell), or the ‘Soul Knil of M. Edwards,’ which was commended
for a good piece. In support of this tradition, Anthony quotes
Gascoigne, whereas Gascoigne, on the contrary, only refers to the
story for the purpose of ridiculing the idea that the ‘Knil’ was
written under any such circumstances.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Cotton MSS. in the British Museum are four poems by Edwards,
one of which is addressed to some court beauties of his time;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span> one
of these also is given by Mr Ellis in his “Specimens.” A part of his
song “In Commendation of Musick,” in the “Paradise of Dainty Devices,”
is given by Shakespeare, “Romeo and Juliet,” act <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr>, sc. 5: “Where
gripyng grief the hart would wound,” &amp;c. Ritson mentions “An Epytaphe
of the lord of Pembroke” by Mr Edwards (1569-70); but
<!--0013.png-->
this is merely
said to be written by a <em>Mr Edwardes</em>, and was not, at any rate,
from the pen of the author of “Damon and Pithias.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Among the books of my friend, the late Mr William Collins, of
Chichester, now dispersed,” writes Warton,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> “was a collection of
short comic stories in prose, printed in the black letter, and, in the
year 1570, ‘Set forth by Maister Richard Edwardes, Mayster of Her
Maiesties Revels.’ There is a mistake in assigning this office to
Edwards, for Sir Thomas Cawarden and Sir Thomas Benger were
successively Masters of the Revels in our author’s time. However,
among these tales was that of the ‘Induction of the Tinker’ in
Shakespeare’s ‘Taming of the Shrew;’ and perhaps,” writes Warton,
“Edwards’ story book was the immediate source from which Shakespeare,
or rather, the author of the old ‘Taming of the Shrew’ drew that
diverting apologue.”</p>

<p>The drama here reprinted from the earliest known edition of 1571,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span>
collated with that of 1582, may have been the same as the
<em>tragedy</em> performed before Queen Elizabeth by the children of the
chapel at Christmas,
<!--0014.png-->
1564-5. “Although,” writes Collier, “Edwards
continued in this play to employ rhymes, he endeavoured to get rid of
some part of its monotony, by varying the length of his lines, and by
not preserving the cæsura. It was nearly new, at the date when this
piece was written, to bring stories from profane history upon the
stage. ‘Damon and Phythias’ was one of the earliest attempts of the
kind; and at any other period, and without the Queen’s extraordinary
commendation, it may at least be doubted whether Edwards would have
acquired an equal degree of notoriety.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_11" id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span></p>

<div class="versei0">That I, Aristippus, a courtier am become:</div>
<div class="versei0">A philosopher of late, not of the meanest name,</div>
<div class="versei0">But now to the courtly behaviour my life I frame.</div>

<div class="versei0">Then who is a philosopher so rightly as I?</div>

<div class="versei0">And I profess now the courtly philosophy,</div>
<div class="versei0">To crouch, to speak fair, myself I apply,</div>
<div class="versei0">To feed the king’s humour with pleasant devices,</div>
<div class="versei0">For which I am called <i lang="la">Regius canis</i>.</div>

<div class="versei0">Let him roll in his tub, to win a vain praise:</div>
<div class="versei0">In the court pleasantly I will spend all my days;</div>
<div class="versei0">Wherein what to do I am not to learn,</div>
<div class="versei0">What will serve mine own turn, I can quickly discern.</div>

<div class="versei0">A flattering parasite, a sycophant also,</div>

<div class="versei0">Of half a word he can make a legend of lies,</div>

<div class="versei0">He cannot tell one tale, but twice he must lie.</div>

<div class="versei0">A large reward for so simple services.</div>
<div class="versei0">What, then? the king’s praise standeth chiefly in bountifulness:</div>
<div class="versei0">Which thing though I told the king very pleasantly,</div>
<div class="versei0">Yet can I prove it by good writers of great antiquity:</div>
<div class="versei0">But that shall not need at this time, since that I have abundantly:</div>
<div class="versei0">When I lack hereafter, I will use this point of philosophy:</div>
<div class="versei0">But now, whereas I have felt the king’s liberality,</div>
<div class="versei0">As princely as it came, I will spend it as regally:</div>
<div class="versei0">Money is current, men say, and current comes of <em>Currendo</em>:</div>
<div class="versei0">Then will I make money run, as his nature requireth, I trow.</div>
<div class="versei0">For what becomes a philosopher best,</div>
<div class="versei0">But to despise money above the rest?</div>
<div class="versei0">And yet not so despise it, but to have in store</div>
<div class="versei0">Enough to serve his own turn, and somewhat more.</div>
<div class="versei0">With sundry sports and taunts yesternight I delighted the king,</div>
<div class="versei0">That with his loud laughter the whole court did ring,</div>
<div class="versei0">And I thought he laugh’d not merrier than I, when I got this money.</div>
<div class="versei0">But, mumbudget,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_53" id="fnanchor_53"></a><a href="#footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></span> for Carisophus I espy</div>

<div class="versei0">He was come hither to know the state of the city;</div>
<div class="versei0">And not only this, but that he would understand</div>
<div class="versei0">The state of Dionysius’ court and of the whole land.</div>
<div class="versei0">Which words when I heard, I desired him to stay,</div>
<div class="versei0">Till I had done a little business of the way.</div>
<div class="versei0">Promising him to return again quickly; and so did convey</div>
<div class="versei0">Myself to the court for Snap the tipstaff, which came and upsnatched him,</div>
<div class="versei0">Brought him to the court, and in the porter’s lodge dispatched him,</div>
<!--0045.png-->
<div class="versei0">After I ran to Dionysius, as fast as I could,</div>

<div class="versei0">This court is clean altered: who would have thought this?</div>
<div class="versei0">Dionysius, of late so pleasant and merry,</div>
<div class="versei0">Is quite changed now into such melancholy,</div>

<div class="versei0">In so much that, when I in pleasant words began to play,</div>
<div class="versei0">So sternly he frowned on me, and knit me up so short,</div>

<div class="versei0">And hath incensed the king against him so despitefully,</div>
<div class="versei0">That Dionysius hath judged him to-morrow to die.</div>
<div class="versei0">I have talk’d with Damon, whom though in words I found very witty,</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="versei0"><span class="sc">Aristippus.</span> By mine own experience I prove true that many men tell,</div>
<div class="versei0">To live in court not beloved, better be in hell:</div>
<div class="versei0">What crying out, what cursing, is there within of Carisophus,</div>
<div class="versei0">Because he accused Damon to King Dionysius!</div>
<div class="versei0">Even now he came whining and crying into the court for the nonce,</div>
<div class="versei0">Showing that one Onaphets had broke his knave’s sconce.</div>
<div class="versei0">Which strange name when they heard every man laugh’d heartily,</div>
<div class="versei0">And I by myself scann’d his name secretly;</div>
<div class="versei0">For well I knew it was some mad-headed child</div>
<div class="versei0">That invented this name, that the log-headed knave might be beguil’d.</div>
<div class="versei0">In tossing it often with myself to and fro,</div>
<div class="versei0">I found out that Onaphets backward spelled Stephano.</div>
<div class="versei0">I smiled in my sleeve, how to see by turning his name he dress’d him,</div>
<div class="versei0">And how for Damon his master’s sake with a wooden cudgel he bless’d him.</div>
<div class="versei0">None pitied the knave, no man nor woman; but all laugh’d him to scorn.</div>
<div class="versei0">To be thus hated of all, better unborn:</div>
<div class="versei0">Far better Aristippus hath provided, I trow;</div>
<div class="versei0">For in all the court I am beloved both of high and low.</div>
<div class="versei0">I offend none, insomuch that women sing this to my great praise,</div>

<div class="versei0">Whom Carisophus accused: Damon is now at liberty,</div>
<div class="versei0">For whose return Pithias his friend lieth in prison, alas, in great jeopardy.</div>
<div class="versei0">To-morrow is the day, which day by noon if Damon return not, earnestly</div>
<div class="versei0">The king hath sworn that Pithias should die;</div>
<div class="versei0">Whereof Pithias hath intelligence very secretly,</div>
<div class="versei0">Wishing that Damon may not return, till he hath paid</div>
<div class="versei0">His life for his friend. Hath it been heretofore ever said,</div>
<div class="versei0">That any man for his friend would die so willingly?</div>
<div class="versei0">O noble friendship! O perfect amity!</div>
<div class="versei0">Thy force is here seen, and that very perfectly.</div>
<div class="versei0">The king himself museth hereat, yet he is far out of square,</div>
<div class="versei0">That he trusteth none to come near him: not even his own daughters will he have</div>
<div class="versei0">Unsearch’d to enter his chamber, while<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_86" id="fnanchor_86"></a><a href="#footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></span> he hath made barbers his beard to shave,</div>
<div class="versei0">Not with knife or razor, for all edge-tools he fears,</div>
<div class="versei0">But with hot burning nutshells they singe off his hairs.</div>
<div class="versei0">Was there ever man that lived in such misery?</div>
<div class="versei0">Well, I will go in&mdash;with a heavy and pensive heart, too,</div>

 Although it is obvious that great pains were taken by Mr Reed and
others (to say nothing of Dodsley) in the collation of this
dramatic piece, yet they left it in a very imperfect state. In
the course of it not less than fifty important variations and
errors have been detected, consisting of words omitted, and words
accidentally inserted, independently of errors of the press, for
which of course an editor was not responsible. It is hoped that
it will be now found more uniformly correct, although the editor
can scarcely flatter himself that the reprint may not be still
found defective.&mdash;<cite>Collier.</cite></p>

 A proverbial expression often found in ancient writers. Heywood
has it: “Happy man, happy <em>dole</em>.” See Dyce’s Glossary to
his second edition of Shakespeare, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 201. <em>Dole</em>, Mr
Steevens observes (Notes to “The Taming of the Shrew,” act <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>,
<abbr title="scene">sc.</abbr> 1), is any thing dealt out or distributed, though its
original meaning was the provision given away at the doors of
great men’s houses. It is generally written <em>be his dole</em>,
though Ray, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 116, gives it as in the second <abbr title="quarto">4to</abbr> <em>by</em> his
dole. Shakespeare also uses the phrase in “The Merry Wives of
Windsor.”</p>

<em>cat</em> should be changed to <em>cate</em>; “an old word for a
<em>cake</em> or other <em>aumalette</em>, which being usually
<em>fried</em>, and consequently <em>turn’d in the pan</em>, does
therefore very aptly express the changing of sides in politics or
religion, or, as we otherwise say, <em>the turning one’s coat</em>.
<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>, 1754, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 66. Another writer,
however, gives the following [very absurd] explanation of it:&mdash;
“<em>Capitan</em>, to turn <em>capitan</em>, from a people called
<em>Catipani</em>, in <em>Calabria</em> and <em>Apulia</em>, who got an
ill name by reason of their perfidy; very falsely by us called
<em>Cat in pan</em>.”&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 172.</p>

which he might perhaps have been supposed to pronounce]
<em>Murlons</em> on account of their size. <em>Merlins</em> were the
smallest species of hawks. Turbervile says, “These <em>merlyns</em>
are very much like the haggart falcon in plume, in seare of the
foote, in beake and talons. So as there seemeth to be no oddes or
difference at al betwixt them save only in the <em>bignesse</em>,
for she hath like demeanure, like plume, and very like conditions
to the falcon, and in hir kind is of like courage, and therefore
must be kept as choycely and as daintly as the falcon.” The
<em>merlin</em> was chiefly used to fly at small birds; and Latham
says, it was particularly appropriated to the service of ladies.</p>

 Bate me an ace, quoth Bolton, is among the Proverbs published by
Mr Ray. That gentleman adds, “Who this <em>Bolton</em> was I know
not, neither is it worth enquiring. One of this name might happen
to say, <em>Bate me an ace</em>, and, for the coincidence of the
first letters of the two words <em>Bate</em> and <em>Bolton</em>, it
grew to be a proverb. We have many of the like original; as
<em>v.g.</em> Sup, Simon, &amp;c., Stay, quoth Stringer, &amp;c. There goes
a story of Queen Elizabeth, that being presented with a
Collection of English Proverbs, and told by the author that it
contained all the English Proverbs, nay, replied she, <cite>Bate me
an ace, quoth Bolton</cite>: which Proverb being instantly looked
for, happened to be wanting in his Collection.” [See Hazlitt’s]

<p class="p4 center break larger">MR COLLIER’S PREFACE.</p>

<p class="p2">The “Tragical Comedy of Appius and Virginia” deserves especial notice,
as probably [one of] our earliest extant dramatic productions publicly
represented, the plot of which is derived from history. Sackville’s
“Ferrex and Porrex” was acted before the Queen at Whitehall, and
Edwards’ “Damon and Pithias” also at Court, while the interlude of
“Thersites” merely adopts the name of a historical personage as an
indication of character, without reference to any events in which he
was concerned. “Appius and Virginia” is besides curious as holding a
middle station between the old moralities and historical plays [while
it still retains the allegorical character in some degree].</p>

<p>The performance was printed in 1575, but acted most likely as early as
1563. The initials R. B. on the title-page would apply to more than
one writer about that date. It is a work of great rarity, the only
known copy being in the British Museum. It would be singular therefore
that it has hitherto almost escaped notice, were it not evident that
there are so many plays in the
<!--0113.png-->
Garrick Collection which have never been
read by the editors of Shakespeare. Mr Malone makes one reference to
“Appius and Virginia” in a note on “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” but he
misquotes both the words and the date.</p>

<p>There is internal evidence that it was publicly represented; and with
reference to this point, we find in one place a curious instance of
the ancient simplicity of the construction of an open stage, and of
the directions to the actors: “Here let Virginius go about the
scaffold.” This was the “scaffold hie” on which Herod, according to
Chaucer [“Miller’s Tale”] was accustomed to rant. Hawkins [Orig. Engl.
Dr. <abbr title="one seven">I. vii.</abbr>] tells us that this temporary erection, in Parfre’s
“Candlemas Day,” was called “the <em>Stage</em>,” but he erred from
misquotation. In the following piece we are expressly informed that
<em>Haphazard</em> was the <em>Vice</em>, regarding which character see
Douce’s “Illustr. of Shakesp.” <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr>, 304, &amp;c.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_151" id="fnanchor_151"></a><a href="#footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>[In the former edition nearly all the corruptions of the old copy,
which was edited and printed with the grossest carelessness, were
allowed to remain. A few still stand which baffle our ingenuity.]</p>

<div class="versei0">Without any staggering, I had ready my lie:</div>
<div class="versei0">Out at bridge-meadow and at Benol’s lease (quoth I).</div>
<div class="versei0">Your fatlings are feeding well, sir, the gods be praised,</div>
<div class="versei0">A goodly loume of beef on them is already raised.</div>
<div class="versei0">Then out steps Francis Fabulator, that was never my friend:</div>
<div class="versei0">How pass’d you Carter’s hay-rick at Long Meadow end?</div>
<div class="versei0">There might one (quoth he) within this few days</div>
<div class="versei0">With a cast-net had given four knaves great essays,</div>
<div class="versei0">Under the hedge with a pair of new cards both rip and fledge.</div>
<div class="versei0">Is it true? quoth my Lord: will this gear never be left?</div>
<div class="versei0">This causes swearing and staring, prowling and theft.</div>
<div class="versei0">Well (quoth my lord) take heed, lest I find it,</div>

<p class="p4 center break larger">HAWKINS’S PREFACE.</p>

<p class="p2">This is the play that Shakespeare is supposed to allude to, when he
introduces Falstaff speaking in King Cambyses’ vein, in the “FirstPart of King Henry the Fourth.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_228" id="fnanchor_228"></a><a href="#footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></span>
 It was written early in the reign
of Elizabeth (according to some in 1561), by Thomas Preston, M.A.,
Fellow of King’s College, and afterwards L.D. and Master of Trinity
Hall, in Cambridge. He performed so admirably well in the tragedy of
Dido, before Queen Elizabeth, when she was entertained in that
university in 1564; and did so genteelly and gracefully dispute before
her, that she gave him £20 per annum for so doing. See Thomas Hatcher,
or his continuator, in the catalogue of provosts, fellows, and
scholars of King’s College&mdash;MS. under the year 1560 (Oldys’ MSS. Notes
on Langbaine).</p>

<p>The play is here given from a black-letter copy in Mr Garrick’s
collection, printed by John Allde. [There
<!--0164.png-->
is a second edition from the
press of his son and successor Edward Allde; both are undated.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_229" id="fnanchor_229"></a><a href="#footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></span>]
The prologue and great part of “Cambyses” was written by the author in
long Alexandrines, which the narrowness of the page rendered it
necessary here to subdivide.</p>

<p>The prevailing turn for drollery and comic humour was at first so
strong, that in order to gratify it even in more serious and solemn
scenes, it was necessary still to retain the Vice or artful Buffoon,
who (like his contemporary the privileged Fool in the courts of
princes and castles of great men) was wont to enter into the most
stately assemblies and vent his humour without restraint. We have a
specimen of this character in the play of “Cambyses,” where
Ambidexter, who is expressly called the Vice, enters “with an old
capcase for a helmet and a skimmer for his sword,” in order, as the
author expresses it, “to make pastime.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_230" id="fnanchor_230"></a><a href="#footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>[Besides his play of “Cambyses,” Preston wrote and published two
ballads,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_231" id="fnanchor_231"></a><a href="#footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></span>
 of which Hazlitt gives the full titles, and perhaps
other things lost or unrecovered.
<!--0165.png-->
The best parts of “Cambyses” are
the comic scenes, or those portions of the dialogue which are spoken
by Ambidexter; these seem to indicate that Preston would have been
more successful if he had avoided the tragic vein altogether; but his
language is harsh and unpolished even for the time, as if the play had
been written some years before it appeared in type. Yet this is
scarcely probable, from the allusion to Bishop Bonner towards the
conclusion.</p>

<p>With the admirable comedy of “Ralph Roister Doister” before their
eyes, it might seem strange that later writers should have relapsed
into comparative barbarism, if we had not abundant evidence of such
degeneracy in every period of the history of our dramatic literature,
including that which followed the publication of the unrivalled works
of Shakespeare himself.]</p>

<p class="p4 center break larger">MR COLLIER’S PREFACE.</p>

<hr class="c5" />

<p class="p2">It appears that eight persons, members of the Society of Gray’s Inn,
were engaged in the production of “The Misfortunes of Arthur,” for the
entertainment of Queen Elizabeth, at Greenwich, on the 8th February
1587-8, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, Thomas Hughes, the author of the whole body of the
tragedy; William Fulbecke, who wrote two speeches substituted on the
representation and appended to the old printed copy; Nicholas Trotte,
who furnished the introduction; Francis Flower, who penned choruses
for the first and second acts; Christopher Yelverton, Francis Bacon,
and John Lancaster, who devised the dumb-shows, then usually
accompanying such performances; and a person of the name of
Penruddock, who, assisted by Flower and Lancaster, “directed the
proceedings at court.”</p>

<p>Regarding Hughes and Trotte no information has survived. Fulbecke was
born in 1566; became, as we are told, an eminent writer on the law,
and in the year when this tragedy was brought out, published a work
called “Christian Ethics.” The “Maister Francis Bacon,” spoken of at
the conclusion of the piece, was,
<!--0256.png-->
of course, no other than [the great]
Bacon; and it is a new feature in his biography, though not perhaps
very prominent nor important, that he was so nearly concerned in the
preparation of a play at court. In February 1587-8, he had just
commenced his twenty-eighth year. Christopher Yelverton, as early as
1566, had written the epilogue to Gascoigne’s “Jocasta,” and on the
present occasion was probably resorted to for his experience in such
undertakings. Regarding Flower, Lancaster, and Penruddock we have
nothing to communicate.</p>

<p>“The Misfortunes of Arthur” is a dramatic composition only known to
exist in the Garrick Collection.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_250" id="fnanchor_250"></a><a href="#footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></span>
Judging from internal evidence,
it seems to have been printed with unusual care under the
superintendence of the principal author. In the course of it, some
lines and words were cancelled, and those which were substituted were
pasted over the objectionable passages. In the notes we have given
both versions, and the whole is reprinted as nearly as possible in its
original shape. The mere rarity of this unique drama would not have
recommended it to our notice; but it is not likely that such a man as
Bacon would have lent his aid to the production of a piece which was
not intrinsically good, and unless we much mistake, there is a richer
and a nobler vein of poetry running through it than is to be found in
any previous work of the kind. The blank verse is generally free and
flowing, although now and then deformed by alliteration, and
<!--0257.png-->
rendered
somewhat monotonous by the want of that variety of rhythm, which
Marlowe may be said to have introduced, and which Shakespeare scarcely
exceeded.</p>

<p>Most of the characters, and particularly those of Arthur and Mordred,
are drawn with distinctness and vigour: the fiery and reckless
ambition of the son is excellently contrasted with the cool
determination and natural affection of the father. As an illustration
of the former we may refer to many passages, but especially to several
in the third scene of the second act; while the character and
disposition of the latter are depicted in a masterly manner both
before and after the final battle. This catastrophe, as far as relates
to the death of Mordred, is mentioned by Dante in canto <abbr title="thirty-two">xxxii.</abbr> of his
“Inferno”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" lang="it">
<div class="versei2a">“Non quelli a cui fu rotto il petto e l’ombra.</div>
<div class="versei2">Con esso un colpo per la man d’Artu.”</div>
</div>

<p>The substance of the story is to be found in the “Morte Arthur.” The
action is one, but the unities of time and place are disregarded; and
although the tragedy in many respects is conducted upon the plan of
the ancients, there are in it evident approaches to the irregularity
of our romantic drama. It forms a sort of connecting link between such
pieces of unimpassioned formality as “Ferrex and Porrex,” and
rule-rejecting historical plays, as Shakespeare found them and left
them.</p>

<h4 class="p4 break">THE INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<hr class="c5" />

<p class="p2">An introduction, penned by Nicholas Trotte, Gentleman, one of the
Society of Gray’s Inn, which was pronounced in manner
following:<span class="lock">&mdash;<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>,</span> Three Muses came on the stage apparelled
accordingly, bringing five Gentlemen Students with them, attired in
their usual garments, whom one of the Muses presented to Her Majesty
as captives. The cause whereof she delivered by speech as followeth:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="versei0">Of conquest (gracious queen) the signs and fruits,</div>
<div class="versei0">Achieved ’gainst such as wrongfully withheld</div>
<div class="versei0">The service by choice wits to Muses due,</div>
<div class="versei0">In humblest wise these captives we present.</div>
<div class="versei0">And lest your highness might suspect the gift,</div>
<div class="versei0">As spoil of war that justice might impeach,</div>
<div class="versei0">Hear and discern how just our quarrel was,</div>
<div class="versei0">Avouched (as you see) by good success.</div>
<div class="versei0">A dame there is, whom men Astrœa term,</div>
<div class="versei0">She that pronounceth oracles of laws,</div>
<!--0260.png-->
<div class="versei0">Who to prepare fit servants for her train,</div>
<div class="versei0">As by commission, takes up flow’ring wits,</div>
<div class="versei0">Whom first she schooleth to forget and scorn</div>
<div class="versei0">The noble skills of language and of arts,</div>
<div class="versei0">The wisdom which discourse of stories teach:</div>
<div class="versei0">The ornaments which various knowledge yields.</div>
<div class="versei0">But poesy she hath in most disdain,</div>
<div class="versei0">And marshals it next Folly’s scorned place.</div>
<div class="versei0">Then, when she hath these worthy prints defac’d</div>
<div class="versei0">Out of the minds that can endure her hand.</div>
<div class="versei0">What doth she then supply instead of these?</div>
<div class="versei0">Forsooth, some old reports of altered laws,</div>
<div class="versei0">Clamours of courts, and cavils upon words,</div>
<div class="versei0">Grounds without ground, supported by conceit,</div>
<div class="versei0">And reasons of more subtlety than sense.</div>
<div class="versei0">What shall I say of moot points strange, and doubts</div>
<div class="versei0">Still argued, but never yet agreed?</div>
<div class="versei0">And she that doth deride the poet’s law,</div>
<div class="versei0">Because he must his words in order place,</div>
<div class="versei0">Forgets her forms of pleading, more precise&mdash;</div>
<div class="versei0">More bound to words than is the poet’s lore:</div>
<div class="versei0">And for these fine conceits she fitly chose</div>
<div class="versei0">A tongue that barbarism itself doth use.</div>
<div class="versei0">We, noting all these wrongs, did long expect</div>
<div class="versei0">Their hard condition would have made them wise,</div>
<div class="versei0">To offer us their service, plac’d so ill;</div>
<div class="versei0">But finding them addicted to their choice,</div>
<div class="versei0">And specially desirous to present</div>
<div class="versei0">Your Majesty with fruits of province new,</div>
<div class="versei0">Now did resolve to double force and skill,</div>
<div class="versei0">And found and us’d the vantage of the time,</div>
<div class="versei0">Surpris’d their fort, and took them captives all.</div>
<div class="versei0">So now submiss, as to their state belongs,</div>
<div class="versei0">They gladly yield their homage long withdrawn,</div>
<div class="versei0">And Poetry, which they did most contemn,</div>
<div class="versei0">They glory now her favours for to wear.</div>
<!--0261.png-->
<div class="versei0">My sisters laugh’d to see them take the pen,</div>
<div class="versei0">And lose their wits all in unwonted walks:</div>
<div class="versei0">But to your highness that delight we leave,</div>
<div class="versei0">To see these poets new their style advance.</div>
<div class="versei0">Such as they are, or nought or little worth,</div>
<div class="versei0">Deign to accept, and therewith we beseech,</div>
<div class="versei0">That novelty give price to worthless things.</div>
</div>

<p class="center"><i class="stagedirection">Unto this speech one of the Gentlemen answered
as followeth:</i></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="versei0">Good ladies, unacquaint with cunning reach,</div>
<div class="versei0">And eas’ly led to glory in your pow’r,</div>
<div class="versei0">Hear now abash’d our late dissembled minds.</div>
<div class="versei0">Nor now the first time, as yourselves best know,</div>
<div class="versei0">Ye Muses sought our service to command:</div>
<div class="versei0">Oft have ye wandered from Parnassus Hill,</div>
<div class="versei0">And showed yourselves with sweet and tempting grace,</div>
<div class="versei0">But yet return’d, your train increas’d with few.</div>
<div class="versei0">This resolution doth continue still:</div>
<div class="versei0">Unto Astrea’s name we honour bear,</div>
<div class="versei0">Whose sound perfections we do more admire</div>
<div class="versei0">Than all the vaunted store of Muses’ gifts,</div>
<div class="versei0">Let this be one (which last you put in ure</div>
<div class="versei0">In well depraving that deserveth praise)</div>
<div class="versei0">No eloquence, disguising reason’s shape,</div>
<div class="versei0">Nor poetry, each vain affection’s nurse,</div>

<div class="versei0">Presumptuous sense, whose ignorance dare judge</div>
<div class="versei0">Of things remov’d by reason from her reach.</div>
<div class="versei0">One doubt, in moots by argument increas’d,</div>
<div class="versei0">Clears many doubts experience doth object.</div>
<div class="versei0">The language she first chose, and still retains,</div>

<div class="versei0">Suppresseth mutin force and practice fraud,</div>
<div class="versei0">Things that for worth our studious care deserve:</div>
<div class="versei0">Yet never did we banish nor reject</div>
<div class="versei0">Those ornaments of knowledge nor of tongues:</div>
<div class="versei0">That slander envious ignorance did raise.</div>
<div class="versei0">With Muses still we intercourse allow,</div>

<p class="p2 hanging">The misfortunes of Arthur (Uther Pendragon’s son) reduced into
tragical notes by Thomas Hughes, one of the society of Gray’s Inn, and
here set down as it passed from under his hands, and as it was
presented, excepting certain words and lines, where some of the actors
either helped their memories by brief omission, or fitted their acting
by some alteration; with a note in the end of such speeches as were
penned by others, in lieu of some of these hereafter following.</p>
<!--0264.png-->

<p class="p4 center break"><i>The Argument of the Tragedy.</i></p>

<p>At a banquet made by Uther Pendragon for the
solemnising of his conquest against the Saxons, he
fell enamoured of Igerna, wife to Gorlois, Duke of
Cornwall who, perceiving the king’s passion, departed
with his wife and prepared wars at Cornwall,
where also, in a stronghold beyond him, he placed
her. Then the king levied an army to suppress
him, but waxing impatient of his desire to Igerna,
transformed himself, by Merlin his cunning, into
the likeness of Gorlois, and after his acceptance
with Igerna he returned to his siege, where he
slew Gorlois. Igerna was delivered of Arthur and
Anne, twins of the same birth. Uther Pendragon,
fifteen years after, pursuing the Saxons, was by
them poisoned. Arthur delighted in his sister
Anne, who made him father of Mordred. Seventeen
years after, Lucius Tiberius of Rome demanded
a tribute, due by conquest of Cæsar. Arthur gathered
his powers of thirteen kings besides his
own, and leaving his queen Guenevera in the tuition
of Mordred, to whom likewise he committed
the kingdom in his absence, arrived at France
where, after nine years’ wars, he sent the slain
body of Tiberius unto Rome for the tribute.
During this absence, Mordred grew ambitious, for
th’ effecting whereof he made love to Guenevera,
who gave ear unto him. Then by th’ assistance of
Gilla, a British lord, he usurped, and for maintenance
entertained with large promises the Saxons,
Irish, Picts, and Normans. Guenevera hearing
that Arthur was already embarked for return,
through despair purposing diversely, sometimes to
kill her husband, sometimes to kill herself, at last
resolved to enter into religion. Arthur at his
landing was resisted on the strands of Dover,
<!--0265.png-->
where he put Mordred to flight. The last field
was fought at Cornwall where, after the death of
one hundred and twenty thousand, saving on either
side twenty, Mordred received his death, and
Arthur his deadly wound.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><i>The Argument and Manner of the First Dumb-Show.</i></p>

<p>Sounding the music, there rose three furies from
under the stage, apparelled accordingly with snakes
and flames about their black hair and garments.
The first with a snake in the right hand, and a cup
of wine, with a snake athwart the cup, in the left
hand. The second with a firebrand in the right
hand, and a Cupid in the left. The third with a
whip in the right hand and a Pegasus in the left.
While they went masking about the stage, there
came from another place three nuns, which walked
by themselves. Then after a full sight given to
the beholders, they all parted, the furies to Mordred’s
house, the nuns to the cloister. By the first
fury with the snake and cup was signified the banquet
of Uther Pendragon, and afterward his death,
which ensued by the poisoned cup. The second
fury, with her firebrand and Cupid, represented
Uther’s unlawful heat and love conceived at the
banquet, which never ceased in his posterity. By
the third, with her whip and Pegasus, was prefigured
the cruelty and ambition which thence
ensued and continued to th’ effecting of this
tragedy. By the nuns was signified the remorse
and despair of Guenevera that, wanting other hope,
took a nunnery for her refuge. After their departure,
the four which represented the Chorus
took their places.</p>
<!--0266.png-->

<p class="p2 center"><i>The Argument of the First Act.</i></p>

<p class="hanging">1. In the first scene the spirit of Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, the man
first and most wronged in this history, being despoil’d both of wife,
dukedom, and life, craveth revenge for these injuries, denouncing the
whole misfortune ensuing.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. In the second scene Guenevera, hearing that Arthur was on the seas
returning desperately, menaceth his death, from which intent she is
dissuaded by Fronia, a lady of her court, and privy to her secrets.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. In the third scene Guenevera perplexedly mindeth her own death,
whence being dissuaded by her sister, she resolveth to enter into
religion.</p>

<p class="hanging">4. In the fourth scene Mordred goeth about to persuade Guenevera to
persist in her love, but misseth thereof; and then is exhorted by
Conan (a nobleman of Britain) to reconcile himself to his father at
his coming, but refuseth so to do, and resolveth to keep him from
landing by battle.</p>

some debate thereof, peace is rejected.</p>

<p class="hanging">4. In the fourth scene, the King of Ireland and other foreign princes
assure Mordred of their assistance against Arthur.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><i>The Argument and Manner of the Second Dumb-Show.</i></p>

<p>Whiles the music sounded, there came out of Mordred’s house a man
stately attired, representing a king who, walking once about the
stage, then out of the house appointed for Arthur there came three
Nymphs apparelled accordingly, the first holding a Cornucopia in her
hand, the second a golden branch of olive, the third a sheaf of corn.
These orderly, one after another, offered these presents to the king,
who scornfully refused: a second after which there came a man
bareheaded, with long black shagged hair down to his shoulders,
apparelled with an Irish jacket and shirt, having an Irish dagger by
his side, and a dart in his hand. Who first with a threatening
countenance looking about, and then spying the king, did furiously
chase and drive him into Mordred’s house. The king represented
Mordred; the three Nymphs with their proffers the treaty of peace, for
the which Arthur sent Gawin with an herald unto Mordred, who rejected
it: the Irishman signified Revenge and Fury, which Mordred conceived
after his foil on the shores, whereunto Mordred headlong yieldeth
himself.</p>

<div class="versei0">Amidst our sorest siege and thickest broils</div>
<div class="versei0">She stoutly fought, and fiercely waged wars.</div>
<div class="versei0">Tiberius courage gave, upbraiding oft</div>

<div class="versei0">What shame it were since such achieved spoils,</div>
<div class="versei0">And conquests gain’d both far and wide, to want</div>
<div class="versei0">Of courage then, when most it should be mov’d!</div>
<div class="versei0">How Britons erst paid tribute for their peace,</div>
<div class="versei0">But now rebel and dare them at their doors.</div>
<div class="versei0">For what was France but theirs? Herewith incens’d,</div>
<div class="versei0">They fiercely rav’d, and bent their force afresh.</div>
<div class="versei0">Which Arthur spying, cried with thundering voice;</div>
<div class="versei0">Fie (Britons) fie! what hath bewitch’d you thus?</div>
<div class="versei0">So many nations foil’d, must Romans foil?</div>
<div class="versei0">What sloth is this? Have you forgot to war,</div>

<div class="versei0">Asham’d to shun his foes, inflam’d his friends.</div>
<div class="versei0">Then yielding to his stately steed the reins,</div>
<div class="versei0">He furious drives the Roman troops about:</div>
<!--0285.png-->
<div class="versei0">He plies each place, lest fates mought alter ought,</div>
<div class="versei0">Pursuing hap, and urging each success.</div>
<div class="versei0">He yields in nought, but instantly persists,</div>
<div class="versei0">In all attempts, wherein whatso withstands</div>
<div class="versei0">His wish, he joys to work away by wrack;</div>
<div class="versei0">And matching death to death, no passage seeks</div>
<div class="versei0">But what destruction works with blade or blood.</div>
<div class="versei0">He scorns the yielded way; he fiercely raves</div>
<div class="versei0">To break and bruise the ranks in thickest throngs,</div>
<div class="versei0">All headlong bent and prone to present spoil.</div>
<div class="versei0">The foes enforc’d withstand; but much dismay’d</div>
<div class="versei0">They senseless fight, while millions lose their lives.</div>
<div class="versei0">At length Tiberius, pierc’d with point of spear,</div>
<div class="versei0">Doth bleeding fall, engor’d with deadly wound.</div>
<div class="versei0">Hereat the rest recoil and headlong fly,</div>
<div class="versei0">Each man to save himself. The battle quails,</div>
<div class="versei0">And Britons win unto their most renown.</div>
<div class="versei0">Then Arthur took Tiberius’ breathless corse,</div>

<div class="versei0">Which Arthur ought: as time hereafter serves;</div>
<div class="versei0">He’ll pay the like again, the while he rests</div>
<div class="versei0">Your debtor thus. But O! this sweet success,</div>
<div class="versei0">Pursu’d with greater harms, turn’d soon to sour.</div>

<div class="versei0">Where erst we sought abroad for foes to foil,</div>
<div class="versei0">Behold, our Fates had sent us foes unsought.</div>
<div class="versei0">When foreign realms supplanted want supply,</div>

<div class="versei0">O, rather let due tears and wailings want!</div>
<div class="versei0">Let all in silence sink what hence ensu’d.</div>

<div class="versei0">For Arthur’s fame and valour’s such, as you</div>
<div class="versei0">Should rather imitate, or at the least</div>
<div class="versei0">Envy, if hope of better fancies fail’d:</div>

<div class="versei0">No danger can be thought both safe and oft;</div>

<div class="versei0">As for his strength and skill, I leave to hap:</div>
<div class="versei0">Where many meet, it lies not all in one.</div>
<div class="versei0">What though he vanquish’d have the Roman troops,</div>
<div class="versei0">That boots him not: himself is vanquish’d here.</div>
<div class="versei0">Then weigh your words again: if conquerors ought</div>
<div class="versei0">To seek for peace, the conquered must perforce.</div>
<div class="versei0">But he’ll not yield; he’ll purchase peace with wars.</div>
<div class="versei0">Well, yield that will; I neither will nor can.</div>

<div class="versei0"><span class="sc">Mordred.</span> Trust me, a huge and mighty kingdom ’tis</div>

<div class="versei0">That many have too much, but none enough.</div>
<div class="versei0">It were his praise could he be so content,</div>
<div class="versei0">Which makes you guilty of the greater wrong.</div>
<div class="versei0">Wherefore think on the doubtful state of wars.</div>
<div class="versei0">Where Mars hath sway, he keeps no certain course:</div>
<div class="versei0">Sometimes he lets the weaker to prevail,</div>
<div class="versei0">Sometimes the stronger troops: hope, fear, and rage</div>
<div class="versei0">With eyeless lot rules all uncertain good,</div>
<div class="versei0">Most certain harms be his assured haps.</div>
<div class="versei0">No luck can last; now here, now there it lights:</div>
<div class="versei0">No state alike, chance blindly snatcheth all,</div>

<div class="versei0">But wisdom wills we should forecast the worse.</div>
<div class="versei0">The end allows the act: that plot is wise,</div>

<div class="versei1">Ye princely peers, extoll’d to seats of state,</div>
<div class="versei0">Seek not the fair that soon will turn to foul:</div>
<div class="versei1">Oft is the fall of high and hovering fate,</div>
<div class="versei0">And rare the room which time doth not control.</div>
<div class="versei1">The safest seat is not on highest hill,</div>
<div class="versei1">Where winds and storms and thunders thump their ill:</div>
<div class="versei1">Far safer were to follow sound advice,</div>
<div class="versei1">Than for such pride to pay so dear a price.</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="versei1">The mounting mind that climbs the haughty cliffs,</div>
<div class="versei0">And soaring seeks the tip of lofty type,</div>
<div class="versei1">Intoxicates the brain with giddy drifts,</div>
<div class="versei0">Then rolls and reels and falls at length plum-ripe.</div>
<div class="versei1">Lo, heaving high is of so small forecast,</div>
<div class="versei1">To totter first, and tumble down at last.</div>
<div class="versei1">Yet Pegasus still rears himself on high,</div>
<div class="versei1">And coltishly doth kick the clouds in sky.</div>

<div class="versei1">Who saw the grief engraven in a crown,</div>

<div class="versei0">Nor once vouchsafe to heave it from the ground.</div>
<div class="versei1">Such is the sweet of this ambitious power,</div>
<div class="versei1">No sooner had, than turns oftsoons to sour,</div>

<div class="versei0">With love and lure of kingdoms’ bliss untried!</div>

<p class="hanging">1. In the first scene Cador and Howell incite and
exhort Arthur unto war: who, moved with fatherly
affection towards his son, notwithstanding their
persuasions, resolveth upon peace.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. In the second scene an herald is sent from
Mordred to command Arthur to discharge his
armies under pain of death, or otherwise, if he dare,
to try it by battle.</p>

and soldiers together, whom he exhorteth to pursue
their foes.</p>

<p class="hanging">4. In the fourth scene Arthur, between grief
and despair, resolveth to war.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><i>The Argument and Manner of the Third Dumb-Show.</i></p>

<p>During the music after the second act, there came
upon the stage two gentlemen attired in a peaceable
manner, which brought with them a table,
carpet and cloth: and then having covered the
table they furnish it with incense on the one
end and banquetting dishes on the other end.
Next there came two gentlemen apparelled like
<!--0302.png-->
soldiers, with two naked swords in their hands,
the which they laid across upon the table. Then
there came two sumptuously attired and warlike
who, spying this preparation, smelled the
incense and tasted the banquet. During the
which there came a messenger and delivered
certain letters to those that fed on the dainties:
who, after they had well viewed and perused
the letters, furiously flung the banquet
under feet, and violently snatching the swords
unto them, they hastily went their way. By
the two first that brought in the banquet was
meant the servants of peace: by the second two
were meant the servants of war: by the two
last were meant Arthur and Cador. By the
Messenger and his letters was meant the defiance
from Mordred.</p>

<div class="versei0">In servile sort to Mordred’s cursed pride,</div>

<div class="versei0"><span class="sc">Howell.</span> The noble neck disdains the servile yoke:</div>
<!--0304.png-->
<div class="versei0">Where rule hath pleas’d, subjection seemeth strange.</div>

<div class="versei0">Before the love he bears to kin or son.</div>
<div class="versei0">Your realm destroy’d is ne’er restor’d again,</div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
<div class="versei0"><span class="sc">Arthur.</span> How hard it is to rule th’ aspiring mind,</div>

<div class="versei0">Still to pursue the drift they first decreed,</div>
<div class="versei0">My wonted mind and kingdom lets me know.</div>
<div class="versei0">Think not but, if you drive this hazard on,</div>
<div class="versei0">He desperate will resolve to win or die:</div>
<div class="versei0">Whereof who knows which were the greater guilt,</div>

 <div class="stanza">
<div class="versei0"><span class="sc">Cador.</span> If bloody Mars do so extremely sway,</div>
<div class="versei0">That either son or sire must needs be slain,</div>
<div class="versei0">Give law the choice: let him die that deserves.</div>
<div class="versei0">Each impotent affection notes a want.</div>
<div class="versei0">No worse a vice than lenity in kings:</div>
<div class="versei0">Remiss indulgence soon undoes a realm.</div>
<div class="versei0">He teacheth how to sin that winks at sins,</div>
<div class="versei0">And bids offend that suffereth an offence.</div>
<div class="versei0">The only hope of leave increaseth crimes,</div>
<div class="versei0">And he that pardoneth one, embold’neth all</div>
<div class="versei0">To break the laws. Each patience fostereth wrong.</div>
<div class="versei0">But vice severely punish’d faints at foot,</div>
<div class="versei0">And creeps no further off than where it falls.</div>
<div class="versei0">One sour example will prevent more vice</div>
<div class="versei0">Than all the best persuasions in the world.</div>
<div class="versei0">Rough rigour looks out right, and still prevails:</div>
<div class="versei0">Smooth mildness looks too many ways to thrive.</div>
<div class="versei0">Wherefore, since Mordred’s crimes have wrong’d the laws</div>
<div class="versei0">In so extreme a sort, as is too strange,</div>
<div class="versei0">Let right and justice rule with rigour’s aid,</div>
<div class="versei0">And work his wrack at length, although too late;</div>
<!--0305.png-->
<div class="versei0">That damning laws, so damned by the laws,</div>
<div class="versei0">He may receive his deep deserved doom.</div>

<p>During the music appointed after the third act, there came in a Lady
courtly attired with a counterfeit child in her arms, who walked
softly on the stage. From another place there came a king crowned, who
likewise walked on another part of the stage. From a third place there
came four soldiers all armed who, spying this Lady and King, upon a
sudden pursued the Lady, from whom they violently took her child, and
flung it against the walls; she, in mournful sort wringing her hands,
passed her way. Then in like manner they set on the king, tearing his
crown from his head, and casting it in pieces under feet, drave him by
force away, and so passed themselves over the stage. By this was meant
the fruit of war, which spareth neither man, woman, nor child, with
the end of Mordred’s usurped crown.</p>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
<div class="versei0"><span class="sc">Nuncius.</span> Then list awhile: this instant shall unwrap</div>
<div class="versei0">Those acts, those wars, those hard events, that all</div>
<div class="versei0">The future age shall ever have cause to curse&mdash;</div>
<div class="versei0">Now that the time drew on, when both the camps</div>
<div class="versei0">Should meet in Cornwall fields, th’ appointed place.</div>
<div class="versei0">The reckless troops, whom fates forbad to live</div>
<div class="versei0">Till noon or night, did storm and rave for wars.</div>
<div class="versei0">They swarm’d about their guides, and clust’ring call’d</div>
<div class="versei0">For signs to fight; and fierce with uproars fell,</div>
<div class="versei0">They onwards hal’d the hasting hours of death.</div>
<div class="versei0">A direful frenzy rose: each man his own</div>
<div class="versei0">And public fates all heedless headlong flung.</div>
<div class="versei0">On Mordred’s side were sixty thousand men;</div>
<div class="versei0">Some borrowed powers, some Britons bred at home.</div>
<div class="versei0">The Saxons, Irish, Normans, Picts and Scots</div>
<div class="versei0">Were first in place: the Britons followed last.</div>
<div class="versei0">On Arthur’s side there were as many more:</div>
<div class="versei0">Islandians, Goths, Norwegians, Albans, Danes,</div>
<div class="versei0">Were foreign aids which Arthur brought from France;</div>
<div class="versei0">A trusty troop and tried at many a trench.</div>
<div class="versei0">That now the day was come, wherein our state</div>
<div class="versei0">For aye should fall, whenceforth might men inquire</div>
<div class="versei0">What Britain was, these wars thus near bewray’d.</div>
<div class="versei0">Nor could the heavens no longer hide these harms,</div>
<!--0323.png-->
<div class="versei0">But by prodigious signs portend our plagues.</div>
<div class="versei0">For lo, ere both the camps encountering cop’d,</div>
<div class="versei0">The skies and poles opposed themselves with storms:</div>
<div class="versei0">Both east and west with tempests dark were dimm’d,</div>
<div class="versei0">And showers of hail and rain outrageous pour’d.</div>
<div class="versei0">The heavens were rent, each side the lightnings flash’d,</div>
<div class="versei0">And clouds with hideous claps did thundering roar.</div>
<div class="versei0">The armies, all aghast, did senseless stand,</div>
<div class="versei0">Mistrusting much both force, and foes, and fates;</div>
<div class="versei0">’Twas hard to say which of the two appall’d</div>
<div class="versei0">Them most, the monstrous air or too much fear.</div>
<div class="versei0">When Arthur spied his soldiers thus amaz’d,</div>
<div class="versei0">And hope extinct, and deadly dread drawn on:</div>
<div class="versei0">My mates (quoth he) the gods do scour the skies,</div>
<div class="versei0">The fates contend to work some strange event,</div>
<div class="versei0">And fortune seeks by storms in heavens and earth,</div>
<div class="versei0">What pageants<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_281" id="fnanchor_281"></a><a href="#footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></span>
 she may play for my behoof:</div>
<div class="versei0">Of whom she knows she then deserves not well,</div>
<div class="versei0">When (ling’ring ought) she comes not at the first.</div>
<div class="versei0">Thus said, rejoicing at his dauntless mind,</div>
<div class="versei0">They all reviv’d and former fear recoil’d,</div>
<div class="versei0">By that the light of Titan’s troubled beams</div>
<div class="versei0">Had piercing scattered down the drooping fogs,</div>
<div class="versei0">And greeted both the camps with mutual view.</div>
<div class="versei0">Their choler swells, whiles fell-disposed minds</div>
<div class="versei0">Bounce in their breasts, and stir uncertain storms.</div>
<div class="versei0">Then paleness wan and stern, with cheerless change,</div>
<div class="versei0">Possessing bleak their lips and bloodless cheeks,</div>
<div class="versei0">With troublous trembling, shows their death is near.</div>
<div class="versei0">When Mordred saw the danger thus approach’d,</div>
<div class="versei0">And boist’rous throngs of warriors threat’ning blood,</div>
<!--0324.png-->
<div class="versei0">His instant ruin gave a nod at fates,</div>
<div class="versei0">And mind, though prone to Mars, yet daunted paus’d.</div>
<div class="versei0">The heart which promis’d erst a sure success,</div>
<div class="versei0">Now throbs in doubts, nor can his own attempts</div>
<div class="versei0">Afford him fear, nor Arthur’s yield him hope.</div>
<div class="versei0">This passion lasts not long: he soon recalls</div>
<div class="versei0">His ancient guise, and wonted rage returns.</div>
<div class="versei0">He loathes delays, and scorch’d with sceptre’s lust,</div>
<div class="versei0">The time and place, wherein he oft had wish’d</div>
<div class="versei0">To hazard all upon extremest chance,</div>
<div class="versei0">He offer’d spies, and spied pursues with speed.</div>
<div class="versei0">Then both the armies met with equal might,</div>
<div class="versei0">This stirr’d with wrath, that with desire to rule,</div>
<div class="versei0">And equal prowess was a spur to both.</div>
<div class="versei0">The Irish king whirl’d out a poisoned dart,</div>
<div class="versei0">That lighting pierced deep in Howell’s brains,</div>
<div class="versei0">A peerless prince and near of Arthur’s blood.</div>
<div class="versei0">Hereat the air with uproar loud resounds,</div>
<div class="versei0">Which efts on mountains rough rebounding rears.</div>
<div class="versei0">The trumpets hoarse their trembling tunes do tear,</div>
<div class="versei0">And thund’ring drums their dreadful larums ring.</div>
<div class="versei0">The standards broad are blown and ensigns spread,</div>
<div class="versei0">And every nation bends his wonted wars.</div>
<div class="versei0">Some near their foes, some further off do wound,</div>
<div class="versei0">With dart or sword, or shaft, or pike, or spear;</div>
<div class="versei0">The weapons hide the heavens; a night compos’d</div>
<div class="versei0">Of warlike engines overshades the field.</div>
<div class="versei0">From every side these fatal signs are sent,</div>
<div class="versei0">And boist’rous bangs with thumping thwacks fall thick.</div>
<div class="versei0">Had both these camps been of usurping kings,</div>
<div class="versei0">Had every man thereof a Mordred been,</div>
<div class="versei0">No fiercelier had they fought for all their crowns.</div>
<div class="versei0">The murthers meanless wax’d, no art in fight,</div>
<div class="versei0">Nor way to ward nor try each other’s skill.</div>
<div class="versei0">But thence the blade, and hence the blood ensues.</div>

<div class="versei0">Not far from thence he spied the Irish king,</div>
<div class="versei0">Whose life he took as price of broken truce.</div>
<div class="versei0">Then Cador forward press’d, and haply met</div>
<div class="versei0">The traitor Gilla, worker of these wars,</div>

<div class="versei0">The brethren broach their blood; the sire, the son’s,</div>

<div class="versei0">The which when Mordred saw, and that his sire</div>

<div class="versei0">He sigh’d and ’twixt despair and rage he cried:</div>
<div class="versei0">Here (Arthur), here, and hence the conquest comes:</div>
<div class="versei0">Whiles Mordred lives, the crown is yet unwon!</div>
<div class="versei0">Hereat the prince of prowess, much amaz’d,</div>

<div class="versei0">The wager lay on both their lives and bloods.</div>
<div class="versei0">At length, when Mordred spied his force to faint,</div>
<div class="versei0">And felt himself oppress’d with Arthur’s strength,</div>
<div class="versei0">(O hapless lad, a match unmeet for him)</div>
<div class="versei0">He loathes to live in that afflicted state,</div>
<div class="versei0">And, valiant with a forced virtue, longs</div>

<div class="versei0">I cannot win, yet will I not be won.</div>
<div class="versei0">What! should we shun our fates, or play with Mars,</div>

<div class="versei0">Be we not sought ere this amongst the dead?</div>
<div class="versei0">So many thousands murther’d in our cause,</div>
<div class="versei0">Must we survive, and neither win nor lose?</div>
<div class="versei0">The fates, that will not smile on either side</div>
<div class="versei0">May frown on both. So saying, forth he flings,</div>

<p class="hanging">1. In the first scene Arthur and Cador returned deadly wounded, and
bewailed the misfortunes of themselves and their country, and are
likewise bewailed of the Chorus.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. In the second scene the ghost of Gorlois returneth rejoicing at his
revenge, and wishing ever after a happier fate unto Britain; which
done, he descendeth where he first rose.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><i>The Argument and Manner of the Fifth and Last Dumb Show.</i></p>

<p>Sounding the music, four gentlemen all in black, half-armed,
half-unarmed, with black scarfs overthwart their shoulders, should
come upon the stage. The first bearing aloft in the one hand, on the
truncheon of a spear, an helmet, an arming sword, a gauntlet, &amp;c.,
representing the trophæa: in the other hand a target, depicted with a
man’s heart sore-wounded, and the blood gushing out, crowned with a
crown imperial and a laurel garland; thus written in the top: <i lang="la">En
totum quod superest</i>&mdash;signifying the King of Norway, which spent
himself and all his power for Arthur, and of whom there was left
nothing but his heart to enjoy the conquest that ensued. The second
bearing, in the one hand, a silver vessel full of gold, pearls, and
other jewels, representing the spolia: in the other hand a target,
with an elephant and dragon thereon fiercely combating; the dragon
under the elephant, and sucking, by his extreme heat, the blood from
him, is crushed in pieces with the fall of the elephant, so as both
die at last; this written above: <i lang="la">Victor an victus?</i> representing
the King of Denmark, who fell through Mordred’s wound, having first
with his
<!--0333.png-->
soldiers destroyed the most of Mordred’s army. The third
bearing, in the one hand, a Pyramis with a laurel wreath about it,
representing Victory; in the other hand a target with this device&mdash;a
man sleeping, a snake drawing near to sting him, a lizard, preventing
the snake by fight: the lizard, being deadly wounded, awaketh the man
who, seeing the lizard dying, pursues the snake and kills it; this
written above: <i lang="la">Tibi morimur</i>, signifying Gawin, king of Albany,
slain in Arthur’s defence by Mordred, whom Arthur afterwards slew. The
fourth bearing, in the one hand, a broken pillar, at the top thereof
the crown and sceptre of the vanquished king, both broken asunder,
representing the conquest over usurpation; in the other hand a target,
with two cocks painted thereon, the one lying dead, the other with his
wings broken, his eyes pecked out, and the blood everywhere gushing
forth to the ground; he standing upon the dead cock and crowing over
him, with this emblem in the top: <i lang="la">Qua vici, perdidi</i>, signifying
Cador deadly wounded by Gilla, whom he slew. After these followed a
king languishing, in complete harness black, bruised and battered unto
him, besprinkled with blood; on his head a laurel garland, leaning on
the shoulders of two heralds in mourning gowns and hoods; the one in
Mars his coat of arms, the other in Arthur’s, presenting Arthur
victorious, but yet deadly wounded. There followed a page with a
target, whereon was portraited a pelican pecking her blood out of her
breast to feed her young ones, through which wound she dieth; this
written in the top: <i lang="la">Qua fovi, perii</i>, signifying Arthur’s too
much indulgence of Mordred, the cause of his death. All this
represented the dismayed and unfortunate victory of Arthur, which is
the matter of the Act ensuing.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="versei0">See here by this the tickle trust of time:</div>
<div class="versei0">The false affiance of each mortal force;</div>
<div class="versei0">The wavering weight of fates: the fickle trace,</div>
<div class="versei0">That fortune trips; the many mocks of life;</div>
<div class="versei0">The cheerless change, the easeless brunts and broils,</div>
<div class="versei0">That man abides, the restless race he runs.</div>
<div class="versei0">But most of all, see here the peerless pains:</div>
<div class="versei0">The lasting pangs, the stintless griefs, the tears:</div>
<div class="versei0">The sighs, the groans, the fears, the hopes, the hates:</div>
<div class="versei0">The thoughts and cares, that kingly pomp imparts.</div>
<div class="versei0">What follies, then, bewitch th’ ambitious minds,</div>
<div class="versei0">That thirst for sceptre’s pomp, the well of woes!</div>
<div class="versei0">Whereof (alas!) should wretched man be proud,</div>
<div class="versei0">Whose first conception is but sin, whose birth</div>
<div class="versei0">But pain, whose life but toil, and needs must die?</div>
<div class="versei0">See here the store of great Pendragon’s brood,</div>
<div class="versei0">The t’one quite dead, the t’other hastening on;</div>
<div class="versei0">As men, the son but green, the sire but ripe,</div>
<div class="versei0">Yet both forestall’d, ere half their race were run!</div>
<!--0343.png-->
<div class="versei0">As kings, the mightiest monarchs of this age,</div>
<div class="versei0">Yet both suppressed and vanquished by themselves.</div>
<div class="versei0">Such is the brittle breath of mortal man,</div>
<div class="versei0">Whiles human nature works her daily wracks:</div>
<div class="versei0">Such be the crazed crests of glorious crowns,</div>
<div class="versei0">Whiles worldly powers like sudden puffs do pass.</div>
<div class="versei0">And yet for one that goes, another comes;</div>
<div class="versei0">Some born, some dead: so still the store endures.</div>
<div class="versei0">So that both fates and common care provide,</div>
<div class="versei0">That men must needs be born, and some must rule.</div>
<div class="versei0">Wherefore, ye peers and lordings, lift aloft,</div>
<div class="versei0">And whosoe’er in thrones that judge your thralls,</div>
<div class="versei0">Let not your sovereignty heave you too high,</div>
<div class="versei0">Nor their subjection press them down too low.</div>
<div class="versei0">It is not pride that can augment your power,</div>
<div class="versei0">Nor lowly looks that long can keep them safe.</div>
<div class="versei0">The fates have found a way whereby, ere long,</div>
<div class="versei0">The proud must leave their hope, the meek their fear.</div>
<div class="versei0">Whoe’er received such favour from above,</div>
<div class="versei0">That could assure one day unto himself?</div>
<div class="versei0">Him whom the morning found both stout and strong,</div>
<div class="versei0">The evening left all grovelling on the ground.</div>
<div class="versei0">This breath and heat, wherewith man’s life is fed,</div>
<div class="versei0">Is but a flash or flame, that shines a while,</div>
<div class="versei0">And once extinct is, as it ne’er had been.</div>
<div class="versei0">Corruption hourly frets the body’s frame;</div>
<div class="versei0">Youth tends to age, and age to death by kind.</div>
<div class="versei0">Short is the race, prefixed is the end;</div>
<div class="versei0">Swift is the time, wherein man’s life doth run:</div>
<div class="versei0">But by his deeds t’extend renowm and fame,</div>
<div class="versei0">That only virtue works, which never fades.</div>

 Ben Jonson opens his “Catiline” with the ghost of Sylla “ranging
for revenge,” and he was only thirteen years old, when “The
Misfortunes of Arthur” was performed at Greenwich before the
Queen. Hughes, doubtless, had the commencement of Seneca’s
“Thyestes” in his mind, and throughout he has been indebted more
or less to that and other classical authorities. The ghost of
Polydorus opens the “Hecuba” of Euripides. The ghost of Gorlois
in this instance speaks the prologue to the tragedy.</p>

<p class="p2">From Heywood’s<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_286" id="fnanchor_286"></a><a href="#footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></span> “Apology for Actors,” it appears that Thomas Kyd
was the author of the “Spanish Tragedy, or Hieronimo is Mad again.”
But whether he likewise wrote this “First Part of Jeronimo” does not
appear.</p>

<p>This “First Part of Jeronimo” is so scarce that many have doubted
whether it ever existed; and Mr Coxeter and the author of the
“Playhouse Dictionary” were of opinion, that what is called the
“Spanish Tragedy, or Hieronimo is Mad again,” was only the old play
altered and new-named. Ben Jonson has a passage in the induction to
“Cynthia’s Revels,” 1600, that seems to
<!--0351.png-->
favour that opinion: “Another
swears down all that sit about him, that the old Hieronimo, as it was
first acted, was the only best and judiciously pen’d play of Europe.”</p>

<p>They were, however, two distinct plays, as appears from this copy of
the first part, which is printed from one in the valuable collection
of David Garrick, Esq.</p>

<p>From another passage in the induction to “Cynthia’s Revels,” acted in
1600, it may be conjectured, that “Jeronimo” first appeared on the
stage about the year 1588.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_287" id="fnanchor_287"></a><a href="#footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></span> “They say (says one of the children of
the Queen’s Chapel) the ghosts of some three or four plays,
<em>departed a dozen years since</em>, have been seen walking on your
stage here.”</p>

 It seems probable, from this and several other passages in the
play, that the part of Jeronimo was performed by an actor of low
stature. Decker, in two distinct scenes of his “Satiromastix,”
says that Ben Jonson had supported the character of Jeronimo; but
this assertion most likely applies to the “Spanish Tragedy, or
the Second Part of Jeronimo,” from which he introduces a
quotation.&mdash;<cite>Collier.</cite></p>

 The word <em>cling</em> is so variously used in different authors,
that it is difficult to affix any precise meaning to it. Several
instances are quoted by Mr Steevens, in his Note on “Macbeth,”

<em>cling to him, or not leave him</em>, until he had gratified his
revenge for his friend’s murder.</p>
